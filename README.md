# Summary
This interface provides two PTV Visum procedure sequences (VIS20_SelectLines.xml and VIS20_LoadNetwork.xml) and a master Access Database (LineRoutesAsLinks_Master.accdb) for converting an infrastructure from a [PTV Visum](https://www.ptvgroup.com/en/solutions/products/ptv-visum/) infrastructure network into a [LinTim](https://www.lintim.net/) compatible format. Moreover, a example network (2030_Stuttgart-Cannstatt.ver) is supplied.

The files were created with PTV Visum 20 and Microsoft Access 2019. A detailed manual is available too.
